## 📅 Week 0 — Tools Setup

📌 **Focus:** Installing and verifying the open-source EDA toolchain on Ubuntu 22.04  

| Tool | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Yosys** | RTL Synthesis | ✅ Installed |
| **Icarus Verilog** | Simulation & Testbench | ✅ Installed |
| **GTKWave** | Waveform Viewer | ✅ Installed |
| **Ngspice** | Circuit Simulation | ✅ Installed |
| **Magic** | Layout & DRC | ✅ Installed |
| **OpenLane** | Complete RTL → GDSII Flow | ✅ Installed |

### 🌟 Key Learnings
- Set up the **open-source EDA toolchain** on Ubuntu 22.04.  
- Understood the **role of each tool** in the RTL-to-GDSII flow.  
- Verified installation with **sample test runs**.  
- Prepared the environment for **Week 1 RTL design tasks**.

## 📅 Week 1 — RTL Design Basics

📌 **Focus:** Writing, simulating, and synthesizing basic Verilog designs

| Task | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Verilog Coding** | Designed simple combinational & sequential circuits | ✅ Completed |
| **Icarus Verilog Simulation** | Simulated RTL with testbenches | ✅ Completed |
| **GTKWave Analysis** | Observed waveforms to validate outputs | ✅ Completed |
| **Yosys Synthesis** | Generated synthesized netlists | ✅ Completed |
| **Logic Optimization** | Understood combinational & sequential optimizations | ✅ Completed |

### 🌟 Key Learnings

- Gained hands-on practice with **RTL design using Verilog**.
- Learned how to build **testbenches** and simulate using **Icarus Verilog**.
- Used **GTKWave** for waveform visualization and debugging.
- Ran **Yosys synthesis** to convert RTL to a gate-level netlist.
- Explored the **importance of optimizations** in reducing area, power, and delay.

📌 *Next up: Week 2 — RTL to Gate-Level Synthesis* 🚀
